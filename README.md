## Why Pumler

Pumler is built for architects and tech leads who need fast, reliable diagramming workflows in real teams.

- Real-time collaboration for text-based diagrams
- Live preview while you edit
- Multiple syntaxes in one editor (PlantUML and Structurizr today)
- Free core experience for everyday diagram editing

## Why Another Diagram Editor?

Text-to-diagram workflows are one of the fastest ways to create and maintain technical diagrams. They are easier to version, review, and update than drag-and-drop canvases.

But modern teams still need collaboration, permanent links, and better lifecycle support around those diagrams. Pumler focuses on closing that gap.
